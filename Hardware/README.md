# Hardware files for DA15.

This project was made using EasyEDA Pro (free software).


The screen and encoder are from an [AliExpress module](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005008750619680.html).

There are various models of this screen + encoder module, they all look the same but can have different PCB thicknesses.

The 3D case files only support up to 1.2mm PCB thickness for the screen module.
